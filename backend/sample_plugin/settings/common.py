"""
Common settings for the sample_plugin application.

This module demonstrates how Django App Plugins integrate with the platform's
settings system. Plugin settings are merged with the main settings during
platform initialization.

Plugin Settings Integration:
The plugin_settings function is called during Django startup and receives
the main settings object. You can modify this object to add plugin-specific
configuration that integrates seamlessly with the platform.

Official Documentation:
- Plugin Settings: https://docs.openedx.org/projects/edx-django-utils/en/latest/plugins/how_tos/how_to_create_a_plugin_app.html#plugin-settings
- Django Settings: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/settings/

Settings Organization:
- common.py: Settings for all environments
- production.py: Production-specific overrides
- test.py: Test environment optimizations

Integration Points:
- OPEN_EDX_FILTERS_CONFIG: Register filters with the platform
- API rate limiting and throttling configuration
- Database connection settings for plugin models
- External service integration parameters
- Feature flags and environment-specific toggles

def plugin_settings(settings):
    """
    Configure plugin-specific Django settings.

    This function is called during Django startup to merge plugin settings
    with the main platform configuration. All settings added here become
    available throughout the Django application.

    Args:
        settings (dict): Main Django settings object to modify

    Common Settings Patterns:

    # Plugin-specific configuration
    settings.SAMPLE_PLUGIN_API_RATE_LIMIT = "60/minute"
    settings.SAMPLE_PLUGIN_ARCHIVE_RETENTION_DAYS = 365

    # External service integration
    settings.SAMPLE_PLUGIN_EXTERNAL_API_URL = "https://api.example.com"
    settings.SAMPLE_PLUGIN_API_KEY = "your-api-key"

    # Feature flags
    settings.SAMPLE_PLUGIN_ENABLE_ARCHIVING = True
    settings.SAMPLE_PLUGIN_ENABLE_NOTIFICATIONS = False

    Environment-Specific Settings:
    Different environment files can override these settings:
    - production.py: Stricter rate limits, external API endpoints
    - test.py: Faster timeouts, mock services, in-memory databases
    - development.py: Debug logging, local service endpoints

    Security Considerations:
    - Never commit API keys or secrets to version control
    - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
    - Validate setting values to prevent configuration errors
